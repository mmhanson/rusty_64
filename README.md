A nintendo 64 emulator written in rust.

Right now I'm following along [these tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsi9HPcyrU8&list=PL-sXmdrqqYYcznDg4xwAJWQgNL2gRray2), learning more about the n64 and rust. Once I finish with the tutorials I'll
keep going on my own or maybe get more experience with emulators by writing a NES or chip8 emulator or something. Either way, the plan is to eventually get mario kart running on this thing.
